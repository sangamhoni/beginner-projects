### 1. Number Guessing Game  
<!-- **About the Game** -->
A numerical guessing game where users attempt to identify a secret number chosen by the computer within a defined range. The game offers feedback on each guess to guide users toward the correct number while aiming to minimize the number of attempts.

20 questions is a classic game in which one person thinks of an object and the other person asks a series of yes or no questions in an effort to guess that object. For more details, see: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty_Questions.

### 3. PyScreenshot
It's a simple program using the *pyscreenshot* module to take a screenshot. This program, in particular, takes a full screenshot of your current viewport window.
