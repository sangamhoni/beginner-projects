# 20 Questions
In this game, the computer will challenge you to think of an object from a given category. It will then ask you a series of yes or no questions to figure out which object you have in mind. The computer will always guess correctly within 3 questions, no matter which object you choose. Get ready to test the computer's guessing skills!

## How to Play

## Considerations and Features

#### Input Validation:
- Ensures that only valid "y" or "n" responses are accepted, with other inputs leading to restart of the game.  

#### Intelligent Questioning:
- The sequence of yes/no questions is designed to divide the list of objects efficiently, ensuring the correct object is guessed within 3 questions.  

#### User Experience:  
- Simple and straightforward prompts guide you through the game.
- No repetitive or unnecessary questionsâ€”every question is purposeful and directs the computer toward the correct answer.
